   <h>Week 1:</h>
   <div>
       </div>
             <p>We learned the fundamentals of Java script and practiced the coding conventions and looked At
              Installed necessary programme's (nodejs and visual studio code) we tackled Arrays  variables which can hold more than one value and dot notations for accessing object properties being able to specify 
              On our first Employ-ability session where we got to know each other and talked about our strengths and 
              weaknesses and also cvs. Variables are containers for storing data values. Int age = 28 or string name 
              = “john”; Operators are symbols or keywords that perform operations on variables and values.
              We also looked at if else and loops and while conditions as well and practiced how they work. 
              Created an account on codewars looked at online resources like w3schools
