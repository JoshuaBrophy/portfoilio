            <p>this is my first website im developing it in html5 and styling it with CSS </p>
                 <h>About me</h>
                 <p>
                    I absolutely love to follow current tech, from 3D printing to VR headsets Im a keen 3D designer
                     who also dabbles in Games development, Im also developing a video game with bunch of like-minded 
                     friends in my spare time. My most recent area of study was in VR Development using a games engine 
                     called Unity and worked under NDA for a Client project to develop and utilize my skills while also 
                     working under professional conditions, As an individual, I am resilient, dedicated, professional, 
                     and a great communicator and have strong attention to detail which are keys skills I can bring to 
                     the Game Industry. I decided that I would seek a new challenge and switch careers to Game Development.
                     I have always been interested in Games Development and started to think about how games are an important 
                     part of the current world. Having completed a Games Development boot-camp, I am now ready to secure my 
                     first role in this industry as a Junior Game Developer.

             <div>                
                </div>
            <p>i enjoy playing D&D and warhammer with a couple of friend by weekly on weeknd when we get a chance
               we also play other board games too i also like hiking in the country side with my two dogs.
                </p>
                <h>What made me intersted in code</h>
                <p>i suppose my interest in code probebly started when i was in highschool i read a book
                   on C++ and was resarching game design and was convinced i need to know it to make video games
                   but i was wrong. after i finnised college i got into the design side of game's dev like 
                   concept art and 3D modeling and Games engines. by the time i was in uni i had already began makeing
                   3D animation in my spare time so my focuse tilted into animation but after a good 5 years i 
                   began to use game engines again which i already knew i needed futer learning/ training to be 
                   able to utilise them fully, which will allow me to persue being a games developer combining both code
                   and digital design 
                </p>
            <h>Progress and Targets</h>
            <p>i would like to futer develop this site so that i can show off my coding and game dev skills 
                to show that im passionate about my craft.
            </p>
