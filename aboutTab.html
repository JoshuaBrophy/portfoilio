                <h7>What made me intersted in code</h7>
                <p>i suppose my interest in code probebly started when i was in highschool i read a book
                   on C++ and was resarching game design and was convinced i need to know it to make video games
                   but i was wrong. after i finnised college i got into the design side of game's dev like 
                   concept art and 3D modeling and Games engines. by the time i was in uni i had already began makeing
                   3D animation in my spare time so my focuse tilted into animation but after a good 5 years i 
                   began to use game engines again which i already knew i needed futer learning/ training to be 
                   able to utilise them fully, which will allow me to persue being a games developer combining both code
                   and digital design 
                </p>
