    <h1>Week 2:</h1>
    <p>html and CSS we looked a basic website design and worked up to creating a mock site and running it 
        through the live view to see updated changes after the basic site main page was completed I wanted to 
        add more functionality by adding more pages and for the link to work too. After this, we were 
        introduced to CSS which, to sum up, handles the pages design more effectively and Sql: we looked at 
        databases and the use cases for we then looked a language called SQL which is how these databases are
         navigated we created a query to pull specific data from the database we mocked up 
         in our Employability session we look more in depth into cv structure and do's and dont's as well as 
         relevent ifomation and cover letters
