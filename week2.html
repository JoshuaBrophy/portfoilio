    <h1>Week 2:</h1>
    <p>html and CSS we looked a basic website design and worked up to creating a mock site and running it 
        through the live view to see updated changes after the basic site main page was completed I wanted to 
        add more functionality by adding more pages and for the link to work too. After this, we were 
        introduced to CSS which, to sum up, handles the pages design more effectively and Sql: we looked at 
        databases and the use cases for we then looked a language called SQL which is how these databases are
         navigated we created a query to pull specific data from the database we mocked up 
         in our Employability session we look more in depth into cv structure and do's and dont's as well as 
         relevent ifomation and cover letters

        <h1>Improvements made</h1>
        <p1>i feel that after this week ive become fairly adapt at html and css and if i get stuck i think i now 
            have the knowladge to problem solve with the correct online search 
        </p1>
        <h2>Solutions / most proud of</h2>
        <p2>getting my home page to link up with all my other pages was a head turner at first but i feel
            the CSS is more up my ally ive had fun trying to create a style that look like a certain video Games
            menu system (fallout pip boy)
        </p2>
        <h3>Errors encountered</h3>
        <p3>many many error were encounterd during this project ive ran into a rather annoying problem with my homescreen
            the stacked letters are supposed to be cascading down the screen sort of lik ein the matrix but not 
            as cool.
        </p3>           
        <h4>What you discovered</h4>
        <p4>flexbox's, transitions, stylesheets, image ref, id ref, </p4>
        <h5>Summary of project</h5>
        <p5>in summary working on a website takes a long time to optimise and even quality test thankfuly after a
            bit of feedback im keen on getting this website functional and aesthetically pleasing in my eyes :D.
